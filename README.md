# Robot War Engine

An open-source real-time strategy game engine
that is highly compatible with Total Annihilation data files.

## Build Status

[![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/43armkvatrbaiur5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MHeasell/rwe/branch/master)
[![Travis CI build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MHeasell/rwe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MHeasell/rwe)

## Download

There is currently no stable release.
If you would like try out the latest, bleeding edge version,
the latest zip file and/or installer is available at:

https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MHeasell/rwe/branch/master/artifacts

RWE is currently only available on Windows,
however Linux support is likely when the project reaches a stable version.

Source code is hosted on Github:

## How to Play

1. Create the folder `%AppData%/RWE/Data` and copy your TA data files to it (.hpi, .ufo, rev31.gp3, etc.)
2. Run rwe.exe (if you used the installer, RWE will be in your start menu items)

## Roadmap

With TA data files, the Skirmish menu path (mostly) works,
but don't expect to be able to start a game.
The current aim is to finish implementing the Skirmish menu
and make the "Start" button do something interesting.
